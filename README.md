Hey you don't know which file to take? It's simple.
Take the "osuForLeftHand.ino" file if you use your mouse with your right hand. And therefore take the "osuForRightHand.ino" file if you use your mouse with your left hand. If you need help with anything else you can come and ask your question on this discord server https://discord.gg/ZXsEarurM9
